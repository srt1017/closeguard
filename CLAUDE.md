# CloseGuard - AI-Powered Real Estate Closing Document Fraud Detection System

## Project Overview

CloseGuard is a sophisticated web application that analyzes home closing documents to detect predatory lending practices, fraud, and deceptive cost-shifting. Built specifically for Texas homebuyers, it combines advanced pattern matching with forensic scoring to identify potential violations and provide actionable legal guidance.

## Architecture

### Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS)
- **Location**: `/frontend/`
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with modern gradient design
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Key Features**: Multi-step wizard, forensic dashboard, interactive verification

### Backend (FastAPI + Python)
- **Location**: `/backend/`
- **Framework**: FastAPI with Python
- **PDF Processing**: pdfplumber, PyPDF2
- **Rule Engine**: YAML-based configuration system
- **Deployment**: Railway
- **Key Features**: Context-aware analysis, forensic scoring, rule-based detection

## Core Features

### 1. Forensic Score Dashboard
- **0-100 scoring system** based on detected issues
- **Risk categorization**: HIGH (0-30), MODERATE (30-70), LOW (70-100)
- **Statistics cards**: Total flags, critical issues, protection level
- **Color-coded indicators**: Red, Yellow, Green based on severity

### 2. Context-Aware Document Analysis
- **User questionnaire** captures expectations and promises made
- **Purchase details**: Expected price, loan amount, builder information
- **Promise tracking**: Zero closing costs, buyer agent representation, etc.
- **Enhanced detection** based on user context vs document reality

### 3. Interactive Verification System
- **Smart questions** for each detected flag
- **Yes/No/Unsure responses** with color coding
- **Confirmation logic**: "No" answers confirm issues exist
- **Real-time feedback** with legal guidance
- **Verification summary** with confirmed vs dismissed issues

### 4. Texas Cost Breakdown Analysis
- **Line-by-line cost examination** with payment responsibility
- **Unexpected charge detection** (items typically paid by seller/builder)
- **TX market comparisons** with typical cost ranges
- **Educational content** about builder payment norms
- **Summary totals** for borrower vs seller payments

### 5. Enhanced Flag Display
- **Professional color coding**: High (Red), Medium (Yellow), Low (Blue)
- **Severity badges** with confidence indicators
- **Evidence sections** with document snippets
- **Animated dropdowns** with formatted evidence display

### 6. Layman Explanations System
- **Plain English explanations** for every red flag detected
- **Three-part structure**: What it means, Why it matters, What to do
- **Impact prioritization**: High/Medium/Low with color-coded badges
- **Action Priority Guide** categorizing issues by urgency
- **Critical action warnings** with specific guidance ("Do not sign documents")

## Technical Implementation

### Rule Engine (`/backend/engine.py`)
The core fraud detection system with multiple rule types:

```python
class RuleEngine:
    def calculate_forensic_score(self, flags) -> int
    def categorize_flags_by_severity(self, flags) -> Dict
    def check_text_with_context(self, text, user_context) -> List
```

**Supported Rule Types:**
- `numeric_threshold`: Dollar amount limits
- `calculated_percentage`: Ratio-based detection (e.g., origination fee %)
- `regex_presence`: Pattern detection in document
- `regex_absence`: Missing required patterns
- `compound_rule`: Multiple conditions must be met
- `cross_reference_pattern`: Related field matching (builder/lender relationships)
- `context_comparison`: User expectation vs document reality

### Rules Configuration (`/backend/rules-config.yaml`)
YAML-based rule definitions with 25+ fraud detection rules:

**Critical Error Detection:**
- Loan type contradictions (FHA + Conventional impossible)
- FHA MIP on conventional loans
- Demand features on purchase loans
- Extreme interest percentages (130%+ TIP)

**Predatory Practice Detection:**
- Excessive origination fees (>1.5% of loan)
- High closing cost ratios (>4% of loan)
- Builder captive service relationships
- Missing buyer representation

**Texas-Specific Unexpected Charges:**
- Owner's Title Insurance (should be seller-paid)
- Property surveys (typically seller responsibility)
- Settlement/closing fees (often builder-covered)
- Document prep, notary, courier fees

### Frontend State Management (`/frontend/src/app/page.tsx`)
React state with TypeScript interfaces:

```typescript
interface Report {
  flags: Flag[];
  analytics: {
    forensic_score: number;
    total_flags: number;
    high_severity: number;
  };
}

interface UserContext {
  expectedPurchasePrice?: number;
  expectedLoanAmount?: number;
  promisedZeroClosingCosts: boolean;
  usedBuildersPreferredLender: boolean;
  // ... 15+ context fields
}
```

### Layman Explanations Engine (`/frontend/src/app/page.tsx`)
User communication system with clear explanations:

```typescript
const getLaymanExplanation = (flagRule: string) => ({
  whatItMeans: "Plain English explanation of the issue",
  whyItMatters: "Real impact on user's finances and rights", 
  whatToDo: "Specific actionable steps to take",
  impact: "high" | "medium" | "low"
});
```

### API Endpoints (`/backend/main.py`)
- `POST /upload` - Upload PDF with context for analysis
- `GET /report/{id}` - Retrieve analysis results with analytics
- `GET /reports` - List all reports (admin)
- `DELETE /report/{id}` - Clean up reports

## Key Algorithms

### Forensic Score Calculation
```python
severity_weights = {
    'high': 20,     # Critical issues (🚨 fraud, error)
    'medium': 10,   # Warnings (⚠️ dangerous, excessive)  
    'low': 5        # General issues
}
forensic_score = max(0, 100 - total_deductions)
```

### Context-Aware Detection
- Compares user expectations against document reality
- Enhanced messages for broken promises
- Percentage-based tolerance for price/amount mismatches
- Builder relationship pattern matching

### Verification Logic
- Questions framed so "No" = confirms issue exists
- "Yes" = dismisses issue as expected
- Color coding: Yes=Green, No=Red, Unsure=Yellow
- Legal recommendations trigger on confirmed issues
